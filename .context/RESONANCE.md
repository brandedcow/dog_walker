# The Resonance System: Canine Affinity Hexagram

## This document outlines **The Resonance System**, a player-profile framework modeled after the _Hunter x Hunter_ Nen structure. It defines how a player's **Resonance**—the synchronized frequency between walker and dog—determines their effectiveness across different breeds and environments.

## 1. Core Resonance Traits

Every player profile is built upon five fundamental **Traits**. These represent the raw variables of your Resonance and grow organically based on the specific "vibrations" of the breeds you handle.

| Trait         | Description                                                                            |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Strength**  | Capacity to resist kinetic force and maintain physical control of high-weight breeds.  |
| **Bond**      | The depth of the psychological connection; dictates responsiveness to non-verbal cues. |
| **Awareness** | The detection radius for environmental triggers (squirrels, trash, aggressive dogs).   |
| **Speed**     | Optimization of gait to maximize distance and efficiency of stamina-burn for the dog.  |
| **Mastery**   | The utilization of specialized heuristics to solve "unwalkable" or chaotic edge cases. |

## 2. Affinity Types & Resonance Archetypes

A player’s **Primary Affinity** is their natural "Tuning." This categorization acts as the filter for all future progression and determines the power of your **Hatsu**.

### [Top] The Anchor (Enhancer)

- **Primary Trait**: Strength.
- **The Conflict**: **Nomad (Speed)**.

### [Top Right] The Whisperer (Emitter)

## 3. Secondary Resonance Focus

Your **Secondary Focus** is a dynamic sub-class assigned to the Affinity in which you currently hold the **second-highest accumulated XP**.

- **Organic Specialization**: This focus shifts based on your recent contract history as your "frequency" adapts.
- **Hybrid Techniques**: Possessing a Secondary Focus unlocks specialized skills that blend two playstyles.
- **Synergy Multiplier**: If your Secondary Focus is **Adjacent** to your Primary, XP requirements for hybrid skills are reduced by 20% due to harmonic alignment.

## 4. Hybrid Resonance Techniques

Unlocked at **Mastery Level 5** of your Secondary Focus. These represent a harmonic blend of two distinct playstyles.

| Primary Affinity | Secondary Focus | Technique Name       | Effect Description                                                      |
| :--------------- | :-------------- | :------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Anchor**       | **Whisperer**   | **Weightless Lead**  | Reduces stamina drain of "Titan" breeds by 40% via emotional synchrony. |
| **Whisperer**    | **Tactician**   | **Pre-emptive Calm** | Triggers a calming pulse when hazards enter Awareness radius.           |
| **Tactician**    | **Nomad**       | **Slipstream**       | Navigate narrow gaps at high speed without loss of Focus.               |
| **Nomad**        | **Urbanist**    | **Flow State**       | Highlights high-speed "Green Zones" through dense crowds.               |
| **Urbanist**     | **Specialist**  | **Habitat Mimicry**  | Uses environment to instantly zero out a Specialist dog's stress.       |
| **Specialist**   | **Anchor**      | **Bastion Grip**     | Redirection of aggressive breeds using niche handling and raw power.    |

## 5. Organic Mastery & Breed-Based Leveling

Resonance is not gained through generic points. Instead, **walking specific breeds acts as the catalyst for neural growth** in corresponding categories.

| Dog Category        | Affinity XP    | Representative Breeds                            |
| :------------------ | :------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| **The Titans**      | **Anchor**     | Alaskan Malamute, English Mastiff, Saint Bernard |
| **The Spirits**     | **Whisperer**  | Border Collie, Australian Shepherd, Kelpie       |
| **The High-Strung** | **Tactician**  | Shiba Inu, Jack Russell Terrier, Beagle          |
| **The Sprinters**   | **Nomad**      | Greyhound, Siberian Husky, Vizsla                |
| **The Adapters**    | **Urbanist**   | French Bulldog, Pug, Pembroke Welsh Corgi        |
| **The Enigmas**     | **Specialist** | Reactive Rescues, Wolf-Hybrids, Ancient Breeds   |

## 6. The Resonance Filter (Skill Potency)

Your **Primary Affinity** acts as a tuning fork. You can learn anything, but you can only fully "Resonate" with what aligns with your nature.

- **Primary Type Skills**: **100% Resonance.** (Full power, lowest stamina cost).
- **Adjacent Type Skills**: **80% Resonance.** (Strong synergy, moderate cost).
- **Secondary Type Skills**: **60% Resonance.** (Diminished returns, high cost).
- **Opposite Type Skills**: **40% Resonance.** (The "Hard Cap"; unstable and exhausting).

## 7. The "Hatsu" (Ultimate Abilities)

Upon reaching **Mastery Level 10** in a category, a player unlocks a signature ability governed by the Resonance Filter.

1.  **Anchor - _Event Horizon_**: The leash becomes an immovable physical constant.
2.  **Whisperer - _Pack Pulse_**: A wave of calm that resets the aggression meter of nearby dogs.
3.  **Tactician - _Perfect Pathing_**: Highlights the "Golden Route" to bypass all triggers.
4.  **Nomad - _Kinetic Recharge_**: Converts movement velocity directly into stamina recovery.
5.  **Urbanist - _Urban Phasing_**: Allows the player and dog to ignore crowd collision.
6.  **Specialist - _Formless Style_**: Temporarily adopts the primary affinity of any other type.
