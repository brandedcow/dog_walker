# Dog Walking Affinity System: The Hexagram

This document outlines the **Canine Affinity Hexagram**, a player-profile system modeled after the _Hunter x Hunter_ Nen structure. It defines how a player's personality and natural aptitude determine their effectiveness in managing different breeds, environments, and crisis situations.

## 1. Core Attributes

Every player profile is built upon five fundamental statistics that dictate physical and mental performance during a walk.

| Stat                      | Description                                                                            |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Arm Strength**          | Capacity to resist lunges and maintain physical control of high-weight breeds.         |
| **Canine Bond**           | The depth of the psychological connection; dictates responsiveness to verbal cues.     |
| **Focus**                 | The "Detection Radius" for environmental triggers (squirrels, trash, aggressive dogs). |
| **Walking Speed**         | Base movement velocity and the efficiency of stamina-burn for the dog.                 |
| **Situational Awareness** | Environmental mastery; ability to find shortcuts and predict neighborhood "flow."      |

## 2. Affinity Types & Personality Archetypes

A player’s **Starting Type** is determined by their natural personality. This "Nen-style" categorization dictates learning efficiency across the Hexagram.

### [Top] The Anchor (Enhancer)

- **Persona:** Simple, determined, and protective.
- **Gameplay:** Focuses on brute force and stability.
- **Adjacent Synergies:** Specialist (Niche Mastery) and Whisperer (Bond).
- **The Conflict:** **Nomad (Speed)**. Anchors are static; they struggle with the high-momentum requirement of speed-walking.

### [Top Right] The Whisperer (Emitter)

- **Persona:** Emotional, reactive, and intuitive.
- **Gameplay:** Projects calm energy to manage dog stress levels at a distance.
- **Adjacent Synergies:** Anchor (Strength) and Tactician (Focus).
- **The Conflict:** **Urbanist (Awareness)**. Whisperers look at the dog; Urbanists look at the map. Focusing on both simultaneously is taxing.

### [Bottom Right] The Tactician (Manipulator)

- **Persona:** Logical, argumentative, and protective.
- **Gameplay:** Uses precise timing and "pre-emptive" corrections to avoid conflict.
- **Adjacent Synergies:** Whisperer (Bond) and Nomad (Speed).
- **The Conflict:** **Specialist (Mastery)**. Tacticians hate "wild cards." They struggle with the unpredictable nature of specialist-class dogs.

### [Bottom] The Nomad (Transmuter)

- **Persona:** Whimsical, fickle, and high-energy.
- **Gameplay:** High-velocity movement and stamina management.
- **Adjacent Synergies:** Tactician (Focus) and Urbanist (Awareness).
- **The Conflict:** **Anchor (Strength)**. Nomads rely on flow. Stopping to "anchor" a dog breaks their mechanical momentum.

### [Bottom Left] The Urbanist (Conjurer)

- **Persona:** High-strung, observant, and cautious.
- **Gameplay:** Masters of the environment; uses the city layout to "bypass" difficulty.
- **Adjacent Synergies:** Nomad (Speed) and Specialist (Mastery).
- **The Conflict:** **Whisperer (Bond)**. The Urbanist treats the walk as a navigational puzzle, often neglecting the emotional synchronization required for Whisperer skills.

### [Top Left] The Specialist (Specialist)

- **Persona:** Independent, charismatic, and eccentric.
- **Gameplay:** Unique mechanics for "unwalkable" dogs (reactive, aggressive, or exotic).
- **Adjacent Synergies:** Urbanist (Awareness) and Anchor (Strength).
- **The Conflict:** **Tactician (Focus)**. Specialist methods are often chaotic and defy the "standard logic" that Tacticians rely on.

## 3. Learning Efficiency & Skill Acquisition

A player can learn skills from any category, but the "Distance" from their natural type on the Hexagram determines the cost and effectiveness.

- **Primary Type:** 100% Efficiency (Fastest Leveling / Max Power).
- **Adjacent Types:** 80% Efficiency (Reliable Hybridization).
- **Secondary Types:** 60% Efficiency (Costly to maintain).
- **Opposite Type:** 40% Efficiency (The "Hard Cap" on Mastery).

## 4. The "Hatsu" (Ultimate Abilities)

Each type eventually unlocks a signature ability that breaks the standard rules of the game.

1.  **Anchor - _Event Horizon_:** The leash becomes an immovable physical constant for 10 seconds.
2.  **Whisperer - _Pack Pulse_:** A wave of calm that resets the "Aggression Meter" of every dog in the vicinity.
3.  **Tactician - _Perfect Pathing_:** Highlights the exact "Golden Route" to maximize rewards and avoid all triggers.
4.  **Nomad - _Kinetic Recharge_:** Converts walking speed into stamina; the faster you go, the longer you can run.
5.  **Urbanist - _Urban Phasing_:** Allows the player and dog to ignore crowd collision, moving through busy streets instantly.
6.  **Specialist - _Formless Style_:** Temporarily adopts the primary affinity of any other type on the Hexagram.
